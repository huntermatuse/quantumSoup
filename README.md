A test repo for [birdsong](https://github.com/CorsoSource/birdsong) to interface with Canary Historian.

Here I am testing out different ways to interface with Canary Historian using Python.

## Birdsong - A Python interface to the Canary API
_Make talking to Canary easy_

[Canary](https://canarylabs.com/en/products/historian) is a historian from [Canary Labs](https://github.com/CanaryLabs), and `birdsong` is a library for interfacing with it via Python.

Birdsong will take care of the details of dealing with REST calls, tokens, continuations, and other powerful low level features to let you focus on making Canary sing.

This is just a stupid test for things I should build into birdsong
